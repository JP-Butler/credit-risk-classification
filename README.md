# Module 20 - Supervised Learning 

## Credit Risk Classification Challenge 
In this challenge I used various **Supervised Machine Learning** techniques to create and train a model to make predictions with. In this challenge's context past lending activity data will be used to predict whether potential future borrowers loan requests may be either "healthy" or at low risk of defaulting or high risk of defaulting.
